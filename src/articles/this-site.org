This site is built with [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], [[https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/][GNU M4]], and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].

This site generating approach was strongly inspired by [[https://ldbeth.sdf.org/mcs.html][LdBeth's blog]].

I started my site (this site) for practicing my interested tool chains
and for being known as a job seeker.

The source code for this site is available at this [[https://github.com/idiig/mkhomepg][GitHub Repo]].
